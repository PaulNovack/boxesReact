- Boxes front end in React for CPlus or Go Backends.  A simple mobile app to inventory items in boxes with pictures and description.

- Work in progress.... Missing Nav Bar can test box and items add update delete currently.  Refresh will return to login screen currently (purposefully at moment)

- Works with BoxesCplus with some configuration that must be done manually.

- BoxesGo needs updated for Front End to work properly.
 
- Ability to take picture with phone and replace box image not implemented
